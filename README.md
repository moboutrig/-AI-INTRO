Ready to explore the world of Artificial Intelligence? 🌲🧭 This guide will help you learn the essential skills, step-by-step.  You'll discover how AI works, and how to use it! No more feeling lost – you'll be in control!

**Our Essential Tools (aka Code Stuff):**

1.  **⛰️ NumPy:**
    *   **What it is:**  A tool for doing math really fast, especially with lots of numbers.
    *   **Why we need it:** AI uses a lot of math. NumPy makes the calculations quick and easy.
    *   **Get it Here:** [NumPy](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/numpy)

2.  **🎒 Pandas:**
    *   **What it is:** A tool for organizing and cleaning up information (data).
    *   **Why we need it:** AI needs good, clean data to learn. Pandas helps us prepare the data.
    *   **Get it Here:** [Pandas](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/pandas)
    *   **More Tools!:**
        *   **⏳ Time Series:**  Working with data that changes over time, like stock prices or weather. [Time Series](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/time-series-with-pandas)
        *   **✨ Data Wrangling:**  Fixing messy data and getting it ready to use. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/data-wrangling-with-pandas)

3.  **🗺️ Matplotlib:**
    *   **What it is:** A tool for making charts and graphs from data.
    *   **Why we need it:** It's easier to understand data when you can *see* it in a picture.
    *   **Get it Here:** [Matplotlib](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/visualizations)

4.  **🦉 Scikit-learn:**
    *   **What it is:** A tool that helps us teach computers to learn from data.
    *   **Why we need it:** We want the computer to figure things out on its own, without us telling it *everything*.
     *   **Skills:**
        *   **☀️ Linear Regression:** Predicting a number based on other numbers. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/linear-regression-with-scikit-learn)
        *   **🐻🐿️ Classification:** Sorting things into groups, like identifying different animals. [Classification](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/classification-with-scikit-learn%20)
        *   **🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline:**  Putting all the learning steps together in order. [ML Pipeline](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/machine-learning-pipeline)
        *   **🦺 Train and Evaluate:**  Testing how well the computer has learned. [Train and Evaluate](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/train-and-evalute-machine-learning-models)
        *   **✅ Model Selection:**  Choosing the best way to teach the computer. [Model Selection](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/model-selection-methodology)

5.  **🧠 Neural Networks & Keras:**
    *   **What it is:**  A way to build computer programs that are inspired by how our brains work.
    *   **Why we need it:**  For really difficult problems, we need a powerful approach.
    *  **Subjects:**
        * [Neural Networks](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/neural-networks)
        *   **✨ Keras:**  Makes it easier to build and use neural networks. [Keras](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/keras)
        *   [Keras 2](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/keras-2)

6.  **🦜 Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    *   **What it is:**  Teaching computers to understand and use human language.
    *   **Why we need it:**  So we can talk to computers and they can understand us!
    * **Subjects**
        *   [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/natural-language-processing)
        *   **🗣️ spaCy:**  A tool for quickly and accurately processing language. [spaCy](https://github.com/01-edu/Branch-AI/tree/master/subjects/ai/natural-language-processing-with-spacy)
